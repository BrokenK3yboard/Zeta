- mass recipe get can now also get tags
- recipe crawl event will ignore catalyst items
- Recipe crawl digestion will only target vanilla recipe types as to noc cause problems with unknown recipe types that could have some different interpretation
- moved recipe handler methods in recipe digest event

(sorry for double release i messed up :/)
